## Installation

[Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) if you haven't, then clone this repo and build using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uptudev/pi
cd ./pi
cargo build --release
```

This will build your executable in the `./target/release/` folder, with the filename `pi` on Unix-like systems, and `pi.exe` on Windows. Simply move this file to wherever your OS pulls binaries from, and you can build projects with the `pi` command.

## Usage

The base initializer is run simply via `pi`, but if the project name and language are given, this can streamline the initialization process.

**Tips:**

* Break down instructions into logical steps.
* Use bullet points for succinct explanations.
* Consider creating a separate "Getting Started" guide for beginners.

IDEAS:

migrate to a modular architecture with language functions being in their own folders for readability (libs.rs is getting a bit bloated)

example file structure:
./src/
|-> main.rs
|-> libs/
    |-> base.rs     // contains query, routing, etc
    |-> rust.rs
    |-> js.rs
    |-> ts.rs
    |-> react.rs
    |-> vue.rs
    |-> svelte.rs
    |-> mod.rs      // module declaration
